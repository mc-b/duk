    "The larger and more complex a service mesh becomes, the more difficult it is to understand and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements include discovery, load balancing, troubleshooting, metrics, and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "A service mesh often has more complex operational requirements, such as A/B testing (evaluating two variants), canary rollouts, restrictions, access control, and end-to-end authentication.\n",
